# IT_Employee_Stimulation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing an **IT Employee Dataset** sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhayayare/employee-data-simulation-it-industry) to explore patterns in workforce demographics, salaries, work experience, and departmental distribution.
The aim is to perform **data cleaning, exploration, and visualization** to uncover meaningful insights about employee characteristics and workplace trends.

All analysis and visualizations were created **by me using Google Colab**, ensuring an efficient and collaborative workflow.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Import** → Load the dataset from Kaggle into Google Colab.
2. **Data Cleaning** → Handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** →

   * Age distribution of employees
   * Gender diversity across departments
   * Experience vs. salary trends
   * Department-wise headcount
4. **Visualization** →
